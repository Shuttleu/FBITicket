# FBI Ticket

**What does this do?**

Since FBI 2.3 was released, there is an option to install eShop tickets using nothing but a QR code.
From here you can install the titles directly from Nintendos CDN.
This website will let you choose a title and generate a QR code for you to scan in FBI.

**Why I made this?**

@Housey created a program to generate these QR codes, however, this program only works on Windows Vista or higher.
Since I use macOS, this was rather limiting to me as I would have to boot windows just to scan a QR code.

So I made this webpage to do the same job. As a bonus, it is a web page, so it works on anything with a modern web browser.

**Features:**
- Non diacritic search *(doesn't take notice of accents, so "pokemon" will match "Pok√©mon")*
- Partial search *(allows you to search for part of a titles name, so "eld" will match all "zelda" titles and everything else with "eld" in the title name)*
- Title filtering *(allows you to filter between eShop, DLC, Updates, etc.)*
- Generating QR code for installation with FBI
- Automatically uses the lastest database *(no need to download the database or update it)*
- Multiple-select *(generate a QR code with multiple tickets so you can batch install)*

**How to use:**
* Search for the title you want at the top, there are various filters including region and type of title.
* Click on the title you want *(you can select multiple titles)*
* Scan the QR code
